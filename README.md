# MobilityCorp Q4 2025 Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive solutions for MobilityCorp's mobility-as-a-service platform, addressing three critical business challenges: demand forecasting, battery management, and customer engagement for electric vehicles.

## Business Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Demand Forecasting Challenge
**Problem**: MobilityCorp needs to predict vehicle demand patterns to optimize fleet distribution and reduce operational costs.

**Solution**: Advanced demand forecasting system using machine learning models to predict usage patterns across different locations and time periods.

**Location**: `01-Demand-Forecasting/`

### 2. Battery Management Challenge
**Problem**: Electric vehicles (bikes and scooters) running out of charge, requiring intelligent prioritization for battery swaps and maintenance.

**Solution**: ML-powered battery health monitoring and prioritization system using regression models for real-time assessment and LSTM models for predictive analytics.

**Location**: `02-Battery-Management/`

### 3. Customer Engagement Challenge
**Problem**: Customers use services on an ad-hoc basis rather than for regular daily commutes. Need to increase customer frequency and establish MobilityCorp as a reliable daily transportation solution.

**Solution**: Strategic transit partnerships and integrated mobility solutions to leverage existing commute habits and provide seamless multi-modal transportation.

**Location**: `03-Customer-Engagement/`
